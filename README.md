## Project Plan

_(
    1. Make an array of words representing numbers 1 to 19 because they're unique, they don't follow the same pattern as 20-99.
    2. Make an array of words representing tens (10, 20, etc)
    3. Make an element in the HTML to display the results
    4. Iterate through numbers 1 - 100
    5. Convert each number into word from using arrays from step 1 and 2
    6. Append the word to the holder element from step 3
    7. Seperate the words using commas etc

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

_(
I tried to make things simpler by using just one list to handle both numbers and tens, which made the code shorter. But it got a bit tricky when dealing with "one hundred" since it didn't fit the pattern. This experience taught me that sometimes it's better to keep things a bit more organized, even if it means a little more complexity.
